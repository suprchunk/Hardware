# Hardware
Any and all hardware related items.

What will start as my repository for all hardware related to Voron 3D printers, will surely devolve into a scattered repository for all of my hardware projects.

This is more of a TODO, than a README. Maybe I'll name it so...

But a running list, scattered thoughts, will go here, for now.

Make a TODO.

Heirarchy should be somewhat streamlined to make sense.
-- Hardware
-- Software
-- Mods

OR

-- Hardware
-- -- Mods
-- Software
-- -- Customizations

Will probably need more folders/files as well.
